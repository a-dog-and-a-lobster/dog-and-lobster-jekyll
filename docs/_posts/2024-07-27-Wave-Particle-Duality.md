I came across a Chinese poem line recently, it reads ‘吾不识青天高，黄地厚。唯见月寒日暖，来煎人寿。’

This roughly translates to ‘I don’t know how tall the blue sky is, or how deep the yellow ground goes. All I see are the cold moon and the warm sun, and they sear moral lives away.’

Not quite glass half full.

There is also a line I am a very big fan of; the Persian line: ‘این نیز بگذرد’.

This roughly translates to ‘this too shall pass’. The story goes that a king asked a wise man to come up with a line to be inscribed in the ring, and when he is sad, seeing the ring would make him happy.

The glass is pretty half full in this case.

I think there is a point somewhere in both texts. They talk about time while avoiding mentioning it directly. It’s like the wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics, time is supposed to / will make you sad and less sad, perhaps even happy sometimes.
