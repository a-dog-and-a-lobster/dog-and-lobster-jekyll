I have seen the Charles River on an early March night\
It was like seeing Aphrodie standing in the dark\
Breathless, Calmness, and Loneliness, all blended into One\
A haven for a wretched soul 

The Moon placed a translucent veil on top of Her\
Starts, dimmed, in the river's reflection\
Before me was a glimpse of Eternity\
I felt in love with her then and I am in love with Her now

Midnight sky, choppers swirled to and fro, wanderers stood still\
The West Wind carried waves of\
Endless echoes that resonated with every heartbeat\
Suddenly, the ambient sounds started to fade, quieter, and quieter

I saw a shadow among the water\
Frozen I became, sacred and alone\
The silence turned into whispers and murmurs-\
The glares across the river, animated, no longer still

A tickling sensation crawled on my back, paralyzing me\
Then sound of a quack-quack ended my misery\
I still remembered the pitch-black shadows of the ducklings\
And the slight ghastly cries of the word "Away", till this day

It was the worst of all sweet-dreams and the best of all nightmares\
I was a guest and only a guest in the tale of human and nature\
Then I felt asleep, like all men do, waking up wishing for something more\
For I am almost certain, on that night, I was not alone
