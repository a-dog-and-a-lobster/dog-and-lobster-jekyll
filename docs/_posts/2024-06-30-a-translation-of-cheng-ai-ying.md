伍嵐正和程艾影\
Wu Lanzheng and Cheng Aiying\
從上海到武漢\
From Shanghai to Wuhan\
他們要坐十天馬車\
They need to take the horse carriage for ten days\
三天兩夜的輪船\
Then three days and two nights by ship 

泥路上艾影含著糖\
On the dirty path Aiying had a candy in her mouth\
靠著嵐正的肩膀\
While leaning on Lanzheng’s shoulder\
馬車經過村莊\
The carriage passed by a village\
石路顛簸不渝的情腸\
Rocky road, certain feelings of love

一路望 跌跌撞\
Looking forward while traveling\
Tumbling and turning\
午夜流星何去何往\
Where does the midnight meteor end up\
路海長 青夜曠\
Far road, deep sea\
blue wide night sky\
越過群山追斜陽\
Pass the mountains to chase the setting sun 

撥開面紗回望故鄉\
Unravel the veil, look back to hometown\
只見潮溼的月亮\
All there is is a moist moon\
雨水衝不掉\
The rain cannot wash away\
常德路上爬滿蛛網的門窗\
The spiderweb filled building\
By Changde avenue 

夢裡回到他的身旁\
Return to her side in a dream\
蜜語中風不再涼\
All the sweet talk warms the chilly day\
永遠都像初次見你那樣\
Just like the first time when I saw your face\
使我心蕩漾\
Causing my heart to beat out of my chest

沒有奇蹟 沒有驚喜\
No miracles, no surprises\
塵埃裡花不會哭泣\
In the real world the flowers won’t cry\
沒有質疑 沒有道理\
No doubts, no meanings\
褶皺的信乘飛雨\
Crumpled letters leave with the flying rain

一路望 跌跌撞\

沒有奇蹟 沒有驚喜\
No miracles, no surprises\
塵埃裡花不會哭泣\
In the real world the flowers won’t cry\
沒有質疑 沒有道理\
No doubts, no meanings\
褶皺的信乘飛雨\
Crumpled letters leave with the flying rain

漫山遍野你的臉龐\
The mountains and the fields are filled with your face\
唯有遺忘是最漫長\
Only forgetting takes forever\
這是一條必經的路\
This is a road must travelled\
沒有指引出口的光\
And there is no guiding light to the exit
