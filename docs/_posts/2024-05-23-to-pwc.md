I put past memories of you \
Into a blender called time \
Mixed with moonlight, evening breeze,  \
And the sounds of ocean waves \
Paired by a shot of whiskey distilled \
From the pursuit of a possibility  \
And swallowed it whole  \
I hear a sound of acoustic guitar playing  \
That is humming and fingerpicking  \
By a short hair girl  \
We live as we dream - alone
