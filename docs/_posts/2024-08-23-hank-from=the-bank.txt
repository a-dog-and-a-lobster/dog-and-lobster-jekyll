Catch summer's tail on a bright Sunday morning \
Remove the mooring on the sailboat called Sea Fever \
Invite West Wind to this party of one, along with Fortunate \
Perhaps today, She will finally smile \
No one else in sight, just whisky and I \
Like the Catcher in the Rye \
Like the Hooligan of Long Island \
Vostok sent the first man into outer space, infidel \
There is one home and one home only, the Deep Blue \
Pour the rest of Jack into the sea with yearning and desperation \
A final offer to initiate my pilgrimage home \
Sojourner I was, Sojourner I no longer \
Deep Blue, a lonely sailboat called Sea Fever \
No whisky, and no I
