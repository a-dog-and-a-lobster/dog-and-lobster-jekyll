Selection of writings from 2022 to 2024, about her

Cannot ask the moon to stop waning \
Cannot ask the sky to stop crying \
cannot ask the Charles to flow south \
Cannot ask the mouth to swallow the truth \
Cannot ask the Long Island Sound to take me whole \
Cannot ask Mount Fuji to be mine and mine alone \
Cannot ask time to settle any score \
Cannot ask her to like me a little bit more
 \
 \
 \
 \
There are things in this life \
Once you have started, it's hard to stop \
Like eating potato chips \
Like drinking whisky \
Like loving her

I fell in love with her then \
I am trying to stop loving her now \
I will stop loving her in due time

But like I said \
There are things in this life \
Once you have started, it's hard to stop
 \
 \
 \
 \
It has been a while, but I still love you \
And part of you will be on my mind until the end of time \
That's just how They made me \
Sad, sentimental, and a little clingy

I love you the way waves love the shore \
Restless, and with no hesitation \
And I love you the way Earth loved the Sun \
23 hours and 56 minutes a day \
365.24 days a year, never missing a beat

Since you made it clear that you do not love me \
I have to move on, though I know I cannot, because \
Part of you will be on my mind until the end of time \
That is just how They made me \
Sad, sentimental, and a little clingy

I want to change the way I love you \
I want to love you the way fire loves everything \
It burns and burns, but dies without proper kindling \
And I want to love you the way Comet Halley loves Earth \
Year 2062, when Earth sees Halley again, is when I hope to see you again
 \
 \
 \
 \
There is something about the way \
The street light touches your face \
The French call it je ne sais quoi \
I call it fall in love
 \
 \
 \
 \
Hey short hair girl\
Can you please walk closer\
Let me take another look at the ring on your\
Right index finger and your left earring\
Your body reminds me of the waves from the Charles River\
Your laugher is the Northeast mellow wind\
I remeber your slightly frowning eyebrows\
Black sweater, blue jeans, and a small tied up ponytail

Hey short hair girl\
Your let go of my hand, in Boston's Spring\
You are not my lover, not my friend, and also not a stranger\
Goodbye short hair girl, let this be the last\
Night that I think of you\
Let me move on, stop looking back\
Let me get drunk on the streets of New York City\
Passed out by the Long Island Sound\
Forget the name of yours, no longer live in the past or a dream
 \
 \
 \
 \
Two years ago, I would not be able to stop myself \
From telling you something \
In the lines of, oh I am at a camping site in Ohio \
And I wish you could be with me \
And see all of the stars I am seeing \
The universe had different plans for the two of us \
Nowadays, you got your troubles \
And I got my problems \
Different troubles, different problems \
Under the same dark, dreamy, and drowning sky \
You are not my lover, not my friend; not even a stranger \
But I do wish you could see what I am seeing \
At this point in time \
Because it is too darn breathtakingly beautiful \
As my eyes adjust to the dark \
Stars after stars appear beyond the black horizon \
Came from the star we are \
Return to the star we shall \
This night shall pass \
Along with my everything
 \
 \
 \
 \
I used to write about you - a lot \
Probably too much - for my own benefit \
Time marches on - days turn to weeks \
Weeks then months - months until now \
Sometimes I wonder if - if I pulled back a little \
Perhaps things would be different - only sometimes \
Other times I dream - if you were the one \
The one - who got away \
Like the song goes - "I'll dream each night \
Of some version of you" - though I stopped dreaming \
About you - a long time ago \
We never really got closure - maybe it's for the best \
I should let you go - my short hair girl \
I promised myself - I would stop writing about you \
Months ago - years ago - an eternity ago \
I ate my words - doing that a lot lately \
Somehow I have a sneak feeling - this time \
It might be true - who am I to say though \
Once a fool in love - always a fool \
In love - even just in the head \
Too quick - to fall in love \
Forever - to fall out of it
