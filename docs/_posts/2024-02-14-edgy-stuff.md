捡起沙滩上的鹅卵石 \
它曾是伤心人一滴的眼泪 \
用力地抛进海里吧 \
今夜起，它将开始沉浮 \
对岸的风景在小雨中模糊 \
那是被人遗弃的二楼房子 \
还是金碧辉煌的大酒店 \
扑通一声，陆地上的海盗 \
听见了什么东西落水的声音 \
夏天的风吹散了夜里的云朵 \
五月的月亮是我的爱人

Pick up that pebble on the beach \
It was a drop of tear from a heartbroken person\
Throw it into the sea with all your strength \
Starting tonight, it drifts up and down with the waves \
The view across water, blurred in the light drizzle \
Is it an abandoned two-story condo \
Or a golden grand hotel \
'Splash', the Pirate on land \
Heard the sound of something hitting the water \
Summer's wind scatter the clouds at midnight \
The Moon in May is my lover
