Sometimes, I don’t feel that I’m designed for the things I do. My ancestors evolved to live in a hostile prehistoric world. Every organ and brain process of theirs was optimized for surviving through a life of predators and prey. My body and brain are identical to theirs, yet my life looks nothing like theirs. The earth has changed quickly, and our bodies haven’t had time to catch up.

**Stress**

I feel that of our outdated adaptations, stress causes the greatest amount of unhappiness for humans at large. Stress helps us solve problems by putting our brain into fight-or-flight mode. It makes us prioritize physical action over thinking and planning. This is useful in life-or-death situations, but boring guys with office jobs don’t end up in many of those. Stress almost always shows up when I need to make an important decision, and it does little other than limit my ability to think rationally.

Whenever work or school make me too stressed to be productive, I’m forced to lay face-down in bed until the wave of stress washes over me. I spend many of my most important days with low sleep from being stressed all night about the events of tomorrow. I see myself underperform in competitive gaming events when the stress of the stakes hinders my thinking. This once-useful skill that my brain deliberately evolved has turned into one of the biggest problems in my life.

**Individualism**

For most of human history, we lived in small clans and worked together for survival. We know that prehistoric humans relied on collaboration and resource-sharing, because an individual couldn’t have survived for long on their own in the wild. Our evolutionary skillset is based around communicating with and learning from others.

Nowadays, we try to live as individually as possible. We see people as successful when they move out of their family home. We see living alone as something to strive for, so we’re striving to defy our instincts!

**What Can You Do?**

I’ve decided to accept that these prehistoric parts of myself aren’t going to change, so rather than fight them, I’ve started listening to them. I’ve found that prehistoric activities that humans were designed to do feel very rewarding. When I’m in a stressful situation, high up on the face of a rock wall, the stress feels fulfilling for my primate brain. I’m aiming to always live with a roommate, and spend as much time as my brain will allow around other people.
