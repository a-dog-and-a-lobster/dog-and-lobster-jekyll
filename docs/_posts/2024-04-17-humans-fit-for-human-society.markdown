Sometimes, I get the impression that I wasn’t designed for the life that I live. I am constantly fighting against my instincts, suppressing them in order to fit in with the society that we’ve built. I suspect that others feel this way, and I think that the reason we feel so out of place is a product of our design. Our ancestors evolved their organs for survival in a hostile prehistoric world. Our brains and bodies are identical to theirs, yet the challenges we face look nothing like theirs. The human experience has changed radically over the past few thousand years, but the human beings have not.

**Stress**

I feel that out of our outdated adaptations, stress is the one with the greatest negative impact on my life. Stress helps us solve problems by putting our brain into fight-or-flight mode. It makes us prioritize physical action over thinking and planning. It was useful for my ancestors in their life-or-death situations, but their boring office-job descendant doesn’t end up in many of those. Stress always shows up when I need to think carefully and make an important decision, and serves only to limit my ability to think rationally.

Whenever work or school makes me too stressed to focus, I’m forced to lay face-down in bed until the wave of stress washes over me. I spend many of my most consequential days on low sleep, having been stressed all night about the events of the day. I see myself underperform in competitive situations when the stress of the stakes hinders my thinking. This once-useful skill is now something I fight to overcome.

**Individualism**

For most of human history, we lived in small clans and worked together for survival. We know that prehistoric humans were reliant on collaboration and resource-sharing, because an individual human does not thrive in the wild. Our evolutionary skillset is based around communicating with and learning from others.

Now that we don’t need to live in a group to have our minimum physical needs met, we have started trying to live as individually as possible. We see people as successful when they move out of their family home and live alone. We believe that being independent is an attractive quality. We pride ourselves on defying our instincts!

**What Can You Do?**

Recently, I’ve been trying to live more in-alignment with my instincts. I’ve found that prehistoric activities that we were designed to do feel very rewarding. When I’m in a tense situation while climbing a rock wall, the stress isn’t crushing. It’s motivating. I’m also trying to feel less-guilty about needing the people around me. My ancestors couldn’t get by without their close groups, and I can’t pretend that I’m built differently from them.
