Two years ago, I would not be able to stop myself \
From telling you something \
In the lines of, oh I am at a camping site in Ohio \
And I wish you could be with me \
And see all of the stars I am seeing \
The universe had different plans for the two of us \
Nowadays, you got your troubles \
And I got my problems \
Different troubles, different problems \
Under the same dark, dreamy, and drowning sky \
You are not my lover, not my friend; not even a stranger \
But I do wish you could see what I am seeing \
At this point in time \ 
Because it is too darn breathtakingly beautiful \ 
As my eyes adjust to the dark \ 
Stars after stars appear beyond the black horizon \ 
Came from the star we are \
Return to the star we shall \ 
This night shall pass \
Along with my everything
