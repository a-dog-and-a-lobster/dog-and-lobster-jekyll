Quietly I have left\
Just like how quietly I have arrived \
Quietly I have walked by\
The late Autumn of New England \
The Crescent Moon by the Charles River\
Was once a friend of mine \
The up-and-down waves\
I had dreamt of, over and over \
Streets full of red and yellow leaves\
Painted a picture that rivals Monetâ€™s \
In days like these\
I wished I was not a wanderer \
The distant mountains beyond the expressway \
They are destinations and possibilities\
Following sunsets to embrace the Night \
Waking up, only to sleep again Daydream? Grab the book on the nightstand \
Sink into the funeral in Her brain \
Dwell in the ocean of possibilities \
Where life steps almost straight \
Dwell though, only for so long\
For reality sinks in, one way or the other \
There is nothing more common\
Than not wanting to say goodbye \
Quiet I have left\
Just like how quietly I have arrived \
I passed out on the Northeast Regional knowing \
One day I will be a wanderer - no longer
