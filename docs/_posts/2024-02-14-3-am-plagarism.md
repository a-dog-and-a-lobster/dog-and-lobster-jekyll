Quietly I have left\
Just like how quietly I have arrived\
Quietly I have passed by\
The late Autumn of New England 

我静静地来了\
正如我静静地走了\
静静的我走过\
新英格兰的晚秋

The Crescent Moon by the Charles River\
Was once a friend of mine\
The up-and-down waves\
I had dreamt of, over and over 

查理湖畔的残月\
曾是我的朋友\
起起伏伏的波浪\
我一次次地梦过

Streets full of red and yellow leaves\
Painted a picture that rivals Monet’s \
In days like these\
I wished I was not a wanderer 

满街的红黄落叶\
绘出了堪比莫奈的画\
在这种日子里\
我多么希望我不是过客

The distant mountains beyond the expressway\
They are destinations and possibilities\
Following sunsets to embrace the Night\
Waking up, only to sleep again 

公路外的远山\
他们是终点，是可能\
随着落日拥抱夜晚\
醒来，只为了又一次沉眠

Daydream? Grab the book on the nightstand\
Sink into the funeral in Her brain \
Dwell in the ocean of possibilities \
Where life steps almost straight 

做白日梦？拿去床头柜上的书本\
坠入她脑中的葬礼\
遨游在可能的海\
那里我的生活似乎走上了正轨

Dwell though, only for so long\
For reality sinks in, one way or the other \
There is nothing more common\
Than not wanting to say goodbye 

遨游，不能太久\
因为现实会把我摇醒\
没有被不想说再见\
更加常见的事情了 

Quiet I have left\
Just like how quietly I have arrived \
I passed out on the Northeast Regional knowing \
One day I will be a wanderer - no longer

静静地我走了\
正如我静静地来了\
我睡着在归家的火车上，深信着\
终有一天，我会是归人
