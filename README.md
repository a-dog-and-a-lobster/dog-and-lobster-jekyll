<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zHrcg16PbJ8/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="doge and lobster" width="400"/>

## Website Plans
- Add a default font, the fonts are kinda random
- Add a comments section to posts, or have an email address for readers to respond to
- Get a cool cartoon banner at the top of a doge and a lobster fighting at dusk, commission Zoey to draw it or generate it with AI
- Make sure it looks good on mobile

## Running the Site
### Installation
1. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/)
2. `cd docs`
3. `bundle install`
4. `bundle exec jekyll serve --force_polling`
